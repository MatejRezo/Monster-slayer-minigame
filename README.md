# Monster-slayer-minigame

Hi and thanks for stoping by to see my minigame. 

Made it using Vue.js Options API. 
Reason why I made it was to practice my Vue skills as well as try Options API.

Task was part of the course made by M.Schwarzmuller. 

I had fun making it and playing it, test it out and tell me do you like it. 
If you have any advice where I could'v fixed my code please leave a comment. 

Made with love,

R.Matej
